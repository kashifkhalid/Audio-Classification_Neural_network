# Audio-Classification_Neural_network
Audio classification is part of digitization of archival audio data project. where audio data from the era of magnetic discs and tapes is converted to digital format. 
the problem with this type data is that it may get corrupt and size of data is huge like thousands of hours of recording. which is practically impossible for a human to listen 
to and sort out. this project helps to classify data using neural networks.

The classification is divided in for categories,i-e, music, silence, noise and speech. 
The project is divided in Three steps:
1- Feature extraction.
2- Network training and tuning.
3- Predictions.

The dataset consisted of around 56000 audio recordings of length 10s.
